1)For the first option, if we comment 'using namespace std' we get 
these errors:

A)In file testcritter.cpp:

a) We get that string is undefined
b) writing 'Cout' and 'Cin' in not allowed (saying undeclared)
c) endl is also considered as undefined
d)getline is also considered undefined, as well as 'name'.

B)In file Critter.cpp:

a)The variable called 'setName' declared void (because the parameter is not defined)
b)newname undeclared (because it is a string which is unknown)

The reason:
We get them since they are defined in ("namespace std") and therefore,
removing the line or commenting it, will give the commands no meaning,
therefore they will not do anything.

The solution:
To solve the erros caused by this, we have to put in front of each one of
the codes above 'std::' in front, resulting in the code to work as good as 
before.

2)For the second option, if we remove Critter:: before the function getHunger
in file Critter.cpp, we get the error:

a)'hunger' was not declared in this scope.

The reason:
the function returns hunger which was declared as a private variable,
which is a special one since it cant be accessed normally as other public
variables.

The solution:
We easily declare the func as a public one in Critter.h, add a void one in testcritter.cpp
and remove the one from Critter.cpp
